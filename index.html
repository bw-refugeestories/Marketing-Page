					<h1>Welcome to Safe Refuge</h1>
					<p>Forgotten. Thrown away. Abused. Tormented. Persecuted. Tortured. Vicitimized.</p>
					<p>These and many other words like them are frequently used to label the millions of refugees and asylum seekers around the world. And many times these same words are used by the refugees and asylum seekers themselves to describe their unique experiences. Safe Refuge is a non-profit organization where refugees and asylum seekers from around the world can safely share the stories of their unique and often times harrowing journies to places where they and their families can finally be and feel safe.</p>
					<p>Located within these pages you will find an ever-growing number of stories written by the refugees and asylum-seekers who actually lived through the experiences. Working in conjunction with <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/">USA for UNHCR</a> (also know as the United Nations Refugee Agency) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/">Amnesty International</a>, we are dedicated to providing a safe refuge for those who are no longer welcome in their own countries. In future evolutions of this website, we will also be listing various non-profits and refugee organizations within the United States where refugees and asylum-seekers can find help within their local communities and where other organizations and community members can offer their time and financial support.</p>

					<h3>Who is a refugee?</h3>
					<p>A refugee is a person who has fled their own country because they are at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution there. The risks to their safety and life were so great that they felt they had no choice but to leave and seek safety outside their country because their own government cannot or will not protect them from those dangers. Refugees have a right to international protection.</p>
					<p>67% of all refugees worldwide come from just five countries: Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content">
					<h3>Who is an asylum-seeker?</h3>
					<p>An asylum-seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasnâ€™t yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right. This means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum.</p>

					<h2>Why do people leave their countries?</h2>
					<p>There are many reasons why it might be too difficult or dangerous for people to stay in their own countries. For example, children, woman and men flee from violence, war, hunger, extreme poverty, because of their sexual or gender orientation, or from the consequences of climate change or other natural disasters. Often people will face a combination of these difficult circumstances.</p>

					<p>People who leave their countries are not always fleeing danger. They might believe they have a better chance of finding work in another country because they have the education or capital to seek opportunities elsewhere. Others might want to join relatives or friends who are already living abroad. Or they might seek to start or finish their education in another country. There are lots of different reasons for people to start a journey to build a life in a new country.</p>

Back in Dar'a, Siham's school was targeted by armed forces, forcing her and her siblings to drop out. When she moved to Za'atari, she was immediately excited to attend school once again.</p></div>
