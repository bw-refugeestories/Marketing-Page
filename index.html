				<h1>Welcome to Safe Refuge</h1>
				<div class="headText">
					
					<p>Forgotten. Thrown away. Abused. Tormented. Persecuted. Tortured. Vicitimized.</p>
					<p>These and many other words like them are frequently used to label the millions of refugees and asylum seekers around the world. And many times these same words are used by the refugees and asylum seekers themselves to describe their unique experiences. Safe Refuge is a non-profit organization where refugees and asylum seekers from around the world can safely share the stories of their unique and often times harrowing journies to places where they and their families can finally be and feel safe.</p>
					<p>Located within these pages you will find an ever-growing number of stories written by the refugees and asylum-seekers who actually lived through the experiences. Working in conjunction with <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/">USA for UNHCR</a> (also know as the United Nations Refugee Agency) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/">Amnesty International</a>, we are dedicated to providing a safe refuge for those who are no longer welcome in their own countries. In future evolutions of this website, we will also be listing various non-profits and refugee organizations within the United States where refugees and asylum-seekers can find help within their local communities and where other organizations and community members can offer their time and financial support.</p>

			<h2>Refugees by the Numbers</h2>
			<div class="refugees">				
				<p>Approximately 1.4 million refugees, who are at particular risk of violence and are for other reasons especially vulnerable, urgently need to be permanently resettled. But only 92,400 refugees were resettled in 2018, less than 7 percent of those awaiting resettlement.</p>

				<p>Wealthier countries aren’t doing nearly enough to share the cost of protecting people who have left everything behind. Appeals for humanitarian assistance for refugees are consistently – and often severely – underfunded.</p>

				<p>In short, the world urgently needs a new, global plan based on genuine international cooperation and a meaningful and fair sharing of responsibilities.</p>
				
				<p>There were 1.1 million new refugees in 2018, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

				<p>Violence, insecurity, persecution and shortages of food, medicine and other basics, have prompted millions of Venezuelans to leave their country. By the first five months of 2019, about 4 million Venezuelans had left their homes in one of the world’s biggest displacement crises. More than 460,000 Venezuelans have sought asylum but to date only a small fraction -- some 21,000 people -- have been recognized as refugees.</p>

				<p>Many wealthier states continue to prioritize policies that will deter people from seeking asylum, and finding ways to stop people coming altogether. At the same time, they are putting the onus on nearby countries to protect people fleeing for their lives. Such restrictive and short-sighted policies are forcing women, men and children to take dangerous land and sea journeys, putting their lives at risk and fuelling human rights abuses.</p>

			<section class="content-section define">				
				<div class="text-content">
					<h3>Who is a refugee?</h3>
					<p>A refugee is a person who has fled their own country because they are at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution there. The risks to their safety and life were so great that they felt they had no choice but to leave and seek safety outside their country because their own government cannot or will not protect them from those dangers. Refugees have a right to international protection.</p>
					<p>67% of all refugees worldwide come from just five countries: Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content">
					<h3>Who is an asylum-seeker?</h3>
					<p>An asylum-seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn’t yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right. This means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum.</p>

				<div class="img-content"></div>

			<section class="content-section explain">
				<h2>Why do people leave their countries?</h2>
				<div class="text-content">
					<p>There are many reasons why it might be too difficult or dangerous for people to stay in their own countries. For example, children, woman and men flee from violence, war, hunger, extreme poverty, because of their sexual or gender orientation, or from the consequences of climate change or other natural disasters. Often people will face a combination of these difficult circumstances.</p>

					<p>People who leave their countries are not always fleeing danger. They might believe they have a better chance of finding work in another country because they have the education or capital to seek opportunities elsewhere. Others might want to join relatives or friends who are already living abroad. Or they might seek to start or finish their education in another country. There are lots of different reasons for people to start a journey to build a life in a new country.</p>

				<h2>Share Your Story</h2>
				<div class="headTxt">
					<p>Every refugee and asylum-seeker has a story to tell. It is from these stories, and the experiences that gave birth to them, that the rest of us learn empathy and compassion for our fellow human beings. It is from these stories that we learn of the gross injustices, oppressions, and persecutions that are being inflicted upon citizens of various countries around the world, not all of them being "third world" countries. And is the stories of these brave and courageous individuals and families that teach us how to take action against these injustices while supporting and loving those who have found it necessary to leave their homes, communities, and countries in order to provide a better and safer life for themselves and the ones that they love.</p>
					<p>For those refugees and asylum-seekers who feel safe enough doing so, we invite you to share your stories with us so that we can share them with the world.</p>

					<p>Siham, age 15, is from Dar'a, Syria. She fled Syria with her parents and six siblings back in 2012 and found refuge in Jordan's Za'atari refugee camp. Back in Dar'a, Siham's school was targeted by armed forces, forcing her and her siblings to drop out. When she moved to Za'atari, she was immediately excited to attend school once again.</p>
